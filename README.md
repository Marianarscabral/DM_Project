## Customer Segmentation for XYZ Sports Company

* This repository contains the final project for the **Data Mining** course as part of the MDSAA program @ NOVAIMS.
* The project aims to develop a **customer segmentation model** for the fictional company XYZ Sports, applying data-driven techniques to enhance marketing strategies and customer retention.

#### Project Objectives

1. **Customer Segmentation**: Using unsupervised learning, we identified customer clusters based on behavioral and demographic attributes to provide XYZ Sports with actionable insights for personalized marketing.
  
2. **Marketing Strategy Development**: Based on the cluster analysis, we proposed tailored marketing actions to improve customer engagement, retention, and profitability.

#### Data and Methodology

The dataset consists of over 14,000 records, containing various features such as demographics, activity history, and subscription details. Our approach includes the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Extensive data cleaning, outlier removal, feature engineering, and normalization were applied to prepare the data for effective clustering.

2. **Clustering Techniques**: Multiple clustering algorithms were tested, including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and K-Prototypes, to capture distinct customer segments. The final clusters were validated through silhouette scores and t-SNE visualizations.

3. **Cluster Analysis and Marketing Plan**: We analyzed each cluster based on profitability and loyalty indicators, identifying customer types such as "True Friends," "Butterflies," and "Strangers." A detailed marketing plan was developed for each segment to optimize engagement and retention.

#### Impact

* This project provides XYZ Sports with a framework for targeting specific customer needs, optimizing marketing resources, and enhancing customer satisfaction. The segmentation insights can inform promotional strategies, loyalty programs, and resource allocation to improve overall customer relationship management.

* The repository includes a Jupyter notebook detailing the analysis and modeling process, as well as a report summarizing the key findings and recommendations.
